				<h4>About this Project</h4>

           		<h6>The electric vehicle is a very exciting topic of research and industrial development.
                    In the last 10 years, rapid development in electric vehicle technology 
                    has been witnessed. Two types of Electric Vehicle techologies are becoming popular,
					Fully Battery operated Electric Vehicles and the Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles.
                    Hence to analyze the growth of these vehicles, we used the data from WA state 
                    which is home to some of the top technology companies and also has a rich tech savvy population. 
                    The objective of this analysis is to present the market trends in top cities 
                    and their counties on the popular choices in terms of make and model. Also, this analysis 
                    presents the data showing the difference in mileage per charge when only electric power is 
					considered for both Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles, which have less than 3 
					batteries on top of a fuel tank vs Fully battery powered Electric vehilcles.
